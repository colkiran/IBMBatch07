Lambdas
-------
anonymous and a single line function

map, filter and reduce

map has an expression that will be implemented on all arguments passed to it. the result of the expression is the return value

filter also has an expression which returns a true or false, if true then the number is given as output else it will not return the number

Reduce
------
from functools import reduce

will convert the list into a single value


Comprehensions
--------------
iterating through a collection using lambda syntaxes
1. list
2. dictionary


Pass by value
-------------
immutable objects


pass by reference
-----------------
mutable objects

Scope of a variable
-------------------
1. local	- Lexical (within a block)

2. global	
3. non local


Decorators
----------
what are decorators?
Decorators are functions that change the behaviour of another function without changing the original functions code

they are design patterns that can be used to extend the functionality of an object such as class, method or function

if a function takes another function an argument or returns a function as reference then we call it as HOF Higher Order Function
